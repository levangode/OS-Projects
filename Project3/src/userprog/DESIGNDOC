---ARGUMENT PASSING---










---ALGORITHMS---








---FILE SYSTEM---
Added file descriptor structure for optimal file managment.   

struct file_descriptor{
	int id; //unique id
	struct file * f; //file pointer
	struct list_elem elem; 
};

Added 'system_global_lock' 

Added file descriptor list to thread struct. 
'struct list fd_list;'





---SYSTEM CALLS---

wait:
	struct thread{
		...
	    struct list child_stat_code_list;
	    struct child_stat_code* stat_code_elem;
	    ...
	}

	struct child_status_code{
  		tid_t child_tid;
 		int status_code;

  		struct semaphore wait_sema;

  		struct list_elem child_status_code_list_elem;
	};

	status code storage:
	status code list added to thread structure for keeping track of children status codes.
	child status codes are kept in thir own structure which is preallocated by parent
	during thread creation and pointer to them is stored in stat_code_elem for easy and
	fast access to status code by executing thread.

	blocking:
	parent thread is blocked on child by pid. the semaphore for given pid is found in 
	child_stat_code_list->child_status_code_elem->wait_sema. parent is blocked until
	child sets its own status code by calling set_status_code(int).

	child list management:
	child list is populated during child thread creation memmory is allocated in heap
	by parent thread. list element is insertid in list and pointer to element is stored in child
	list elements are freed when wait() is called. and also if process_exit is called all
	elements(ie which ones have not been waited) are also freed.
	list only stores elemets which have not been waited so far, so if thread is already waied
	it will not be present in list and error is returned.
